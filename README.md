## Installed NPM, Bootstrap, and jQuery (Bootstrap needs jQuery).<br/>
If you're using VS Code pull up a terminal and install NPM but I think you can download npm for windows here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm<br/>
I am using Ubuntu WSL with Vistual Studio Code which lets me use the terminal like I would in linux so I just use this command to install npm<br/>
```
sudo apt install npm 
```
Then after you have npm installed in the terminal run this command<br/>
```
npm install 
```
That will install all of the dependencies.<br/>
Docs for bootstrap and jQuery check out the examples<br/>
